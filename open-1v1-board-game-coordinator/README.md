# Open 1v1 Board Game Coordinator

With a simple protocol, this project allows to create leagues for 1v1 board games. It's easily extensible for any game but it comes with default othello game.

## Installation

- git clone
- npm install

## Run

Assuming you run it from a terminal within the main folder:

```
node ./bin/www --tid=12 --rrt=2 --game=othello
```

## Arguments

- **tid** (required): tournament id. Choose any positive integer.
- **rrt** (required): number of re-matches in a round robin fashion (normally 2).
- **game** (required): game identifier, currently only supports "othello".

## Protocol Specification 1.0

This game coordinators exposes a simple socket interface to play leagues of 1v1 board games. The following steps are needed to play with this coordinator (examples assuming the use of javascript [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the client side):

### Connect (on connect)

Use your client api to sign in to the coordinator exposed service:

```Javascript
var socket = require('socket.io-client')(URL);  // for example: http://127.0.0.1:3000
socket.on('connect', function(){});
```

### Sign-in (emmit signin)

After the connection callback, you should register your player, for example:

```Javascript
socket.on('connect', function(){
  socket.emit('signin', {
    user_name: "gallanghof",
    tournament_id: 1234,
    user_role: 'player'
  });
});
```

#### Sign-in params
- **user_name**: string, fully qualified javascript id for your username (ie. no spaces, starting with letter, etc.)
- **tournament_id**: int, positive integer to the League you are connecting with.
- **user_role**: string, send "player".

### Waited signals

After the signin signal is emitted, your socket must wait for any of the following three signals:

#### Ok signin (on ok_signin)

Notifies when the signin process was successful. No further action is required after this signal.

```Javascript
socket.on('ok_signin', function(){
  console.log("Successfully signed in!");
});
```

#### Ready (on ready)

This signal is sent when the coordinators tells you should play.

```Javascript
socket.on('ready', function(data){
  var gameID = data.game_id;
  var playerTurnID = data.player_turn_id;
  var board = data.board;
});
```

##### Ready received params
- **game_id**: int, integer representing the id of the game playing.
- **player_turn_id**: int, 1 for player 1, 2 for player 2.
- **board**: [int], 1D array of integers, containing the board representation.

#### Finish (on finish)

This signal is sent when the coordinators tells you the game you were playing has finished.

```Javascript
socket.on('finish', function(data){
  var gameID = data.game_id;
  var playerTurnID = data.player_turn_id;
  var winnerTurnID = data.winner_turn_id;
  var board = data.board;
});
```

### Playing and resetting the board

In order to play and reset the boar, you should emit two signals:

### Play (emit play)

After the ready signal is received, you should play your turn, for example:

```Javascript
socket.on('ready', function(data){
  var gameID = data.game_id;
  var playerTurnID = data.player_turn_id;
  var board = data.board;
  
  // TODO: Your logic / user input here
  
  socket.emit('play', {
    tournament_id: tournamentID,
    player_turn_id: playerTurnID,
    game_id: gameID,
    movement: ?
  });
});
```

#### Play params
- **tournament_id**: int, positive integer to the League you are connecting with.
- **player_turn_id**: int, 1 for player 1, 2 for player 2, but you can simply echo what you received from the ready signal.
- **game_id**: int, integer representing the id of the game playing.
- **movement**: ?, any type representing the movement of the specific game you are playing. For instance, othello only needs an integer representing the tile clicked. 


### Player ready (emit player_ready)

After the finish signal is received, you should reset your availability for your player. This enables the coordinator to match you agains other player. For example:

```Javascript
socket.on('finish', function(data){
  var gameID = data.game_id;
  var playerTurnID = data.player_turn_id;
  var winnerTurnID = data.winner_turn_id;
  var board = data.board;
  
  // TODO: Your cleaning board logic here
  
  socket.emit('player_ready', {
    tournament_id: tournamentID,
    player_turn_id: playerTurnID,
    game_id: gameID
  });
});
```
